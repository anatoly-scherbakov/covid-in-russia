Open dataset about COVID-19 spread in Russia.

## Status

The purpose of this project is to fetch the official government website page with information about COVID-19, encode it into JSON-LD, and publish to IPFS.

Subsequently, the idea is to display this information in a web application.

In the course of developing this, I was able to do some interesting changes to oduwsdl/ipwb tool and learned a bit about JSON-LD. But, now I am going to switch to the web application that will actually display JSON-LD in a user-friendly form.

I can use publicly available JSON-LD documents (for example about some `foaf:Person`) or DBpedia pages as a source material for my potential app.

Maybe I will return to this project later to finally polish it and make its output consumable for Iolanta, but that's not certain.
